##### Hello and welcome.

My name is Finch Ochieng (Japodhi). I'm a computer programmer based in Nairobi, Kenya. I love being around computers and especially enjoy ordering them around.
This here is my blog. My quiet little corner on the internet where I share my thoughts and experiences. 

I'll mainly be writing about my experiences in the fields of software development and computer science in general.
The nature of the content found here is therefore supposed to be informative and hopefully educational.
Should you find the content offensive or inappropriate in any way please do let me know.

It's important to state that any opinions expressed on here are my own.
I am __NOT__ affiliated to any organisation/firm/company/institution that I may mention in the written contents of this blog.
